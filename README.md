# parkin

Parkin is a smart parking application that utilizes an ESP-32 camera and a Flutter mobile application to enable users to book parking spaces in advance and check their occupancy status. The ESP-32 camera, installed at the entrance of the parking area, captures real-time images and communicates occupancy information to the mobile app. Users can search for available spots, make reservations, and receive parking information via QR code through the app.
## Getting Started

This project is in partial fulfillment of the requirements of a Bachelor's Degree in
Computer Information Systems.

The system consists of two components:
1. The Parkin project uses Flutter source code for both Android and iOS.
2. Scripts for the hardware camera implementation using OpenCV.
